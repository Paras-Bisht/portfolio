        <p>
          Hi! Myself Paras Bisht. I am a student currently pursuing my
          bachelor's degree in Information Technology.I want to be a front-end
          web developer. I have good knowledge of programming languages as well
          as front-end techniques. I love structure and order and I also stand
          for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and
          optimizing web apps. In my idle time, i love to read books. Also I
          like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more. As the
          saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.
